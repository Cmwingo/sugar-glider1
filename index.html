        Most people have never heard of sugar gliders, but they make <strong>awesome</strong>
        pets <em>if</em> you know how to care for them. Some things to help get you
        started are:
      </p>
      <ul class="important">
        <li>Make sure they get <strong>plenty</strong> of attention.</li>
        <li>Be sure <b>NOT</b> to give them too much sugar.</li>
        <li><strong>Never</strong> keep sugar gliders in the same room as their natural predators.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Males and females also have different needs.</p>

        Notice the bald spot on the glider on the left. That indicates that he is an adult male.
        <em>Treat him accordingly</em>

        One of the most important things about taking care of your sugar glider is to make sure that
        you are feeding them the proper foods in the right amounts. Skeletal health is one of the most
        crucial areas of this animals life. Gliding requires tiny, strong, healthy bones. Make sure you
        read up on sugar glider diets before committing to this pet. Here's a
